# concrete-mix-design
A web application for the estimation of mixes for both high and normal strength concrete and the unit cost of producing one meter cubed of concrete.
This application enables a concrete mix designer to input material data and estimates the material proportions required to achieve the desired concrete properties, particularly the slump and the required compressive strength.
